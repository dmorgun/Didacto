//Variables and Assignment
//Variables are symbolic names that you define and assign values to. The names given to variables are called 'identifiers'.
// Identifiers can be anything you like given that:

//they are comprised of letters, numbers, _ and $
//they cannot start with a number

//Variables are declared using the `var` keyword and are case-sensitive. You do not have to initialize a variable with
// a value when the variable is declared. The following code declares three new uninitialized variables (a,b and c):


var a,b,c;

//Here are some valid variable definitions:

var netWorth = 19.95;
var temperature = 26;
var three = 1 + 2;

//Declare an variable called 'circumference' and assign the correct circumference based on the given radius and value for PI:
var radius = 5;
var pi = Math.PI;
var circumference = 2*pi*radius
